## Integrating Scientific Modeling, Policy Impact, and Behavioral Factors

![CO2 Emissions Analysis](figures/emissions_analysis.png)

## Abstract

This comprehensive study presents a multi-dimensional analysis of CO2 emissions, combining advanced machine learning models, policy impact assessment, and behavioral factor analysis. Using monthly CO2 emissions data from 1973 to 2023, we developed an ensemble model that achieves superior predictive performance (MSE: 22.73, MAE: 3.91, R²: 0.30) compared to individual models. Our analysis reveals significant correlations between emissions and behavioral factors, with notable policy impacts, particularly during the Paris Agreement and European Green Deal periods.

## 1. Introduction

Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with CO2 emissions being a primary contributor. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of CO2 emission patterns through:

- Advanced predictive modeling using ensemble methods
- Policy impact assessment
- Behavioral factor analysis
- Interactive visualization and dashboard development

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing

The study utilizes monthly CO2 emissions data from 1973 to 2023, supplemented with:
- Policy implementation dates
- Behavioral indicators
- Economic factors
- Seasonal patterns

### 2.2 Model Development

We implemented and compared multiple models:

1. **ARIMA (70% weight in ensemble)**
   - Captures temporal dependencies
   - Handles seasonality
   - MSE: 33.17

2. **XGBoost (30% weight in ensemble)**
   - Captures complex non-linear patterns
   - MSE: 8.92
   - Best individual model performance

3. **Prophet**
   - Handles seasonality and trends
   - Accounts for holidays and special events

4. **LSTM**
   - Deep learning approach
   - Captures long-term dependencies

### 2.3 Feature Engineering

Advanced features were developed:
- Temporal features (year, month, quarter)
- Cyclical features (sine/cosine transformations)
- Trend features
- Lag features (1-12 months)
- Moving averages (3-12 months)
- Seasonal indicators
